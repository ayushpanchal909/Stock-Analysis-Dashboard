## Stock Analysis Dashboard
In this project, I used Python and the Yahoo Finance API to gather stock price data. Then, I automated the data cleaning and integration with Excel. Whenever a new stock file is imported, it's automatically cleaned and imported into Power BI. 

In Power BI, I created essential calculated columns and measures using DAX. I established relationships between the data. The data consists of date, close, high, low, and open values for each stock.

I designed a user-friendly dashboard for descriptive analysis of stock prices. Additionally, I enabled the comparison of stock trends across different stocks. This project streamlines the process of analyzing stock trends and makes it easily accessible.

### Objective
>How can we use the 'Stock Trends by Days' time series chart to analyze and understand historical daily stock price fluctuations for better decision-making?

>Illustrate the level of price variability or risk in a stock, aiding investors in assessing potential market fluctuations and making informed investment choices.

>visually contrast the historical price movements of two stocks over time, facilitating analysis for investment decisions or performance evaluation.

This line chart serves as a visual representation of the historical trend in the closing price of a stock over a specified period of time. By plotting time on the X-axis and the stock's closing prices on the Y-axis, it provides a clear and intuitive way to track and analyze how the stock's value has changed over time, aiding in identifying patterns, trends, and potential investment opportunities.

The candlestick chart visually conveys the volatility in a stock's price. Each candlestick represents a trading period, with the top and bottom of the candle showing the price range (high and low), while the body reflects the opening and closing prices. It enables quick assessment of price fluctuations and potential trends.

The line chart facilitates a side-by-side comparison of two stock price trends over time. It employs time as the X-axis and the respective stock prices as the Y-axis for each stock. This visual representation allows for easy identification of relative performance, trend divergences, or correlations between the two stocks, aiding investors and analysts in decision-making and trend analysis.
